            <p>
              I was born in Dallas, Texas, where I spent ten years as a proud Carroll Dragon. That‚Äôs where I first picked up football‚Äîthough the red tape on the back of my helmet reminded the quarterback not to give me the ball‚Äîand basketball, a sport I‚Äôve stuck with throughout my life. I can‚Äôt say I remember much from those early years, but everything began to feel more vivid when my family moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Riyadh, I became an American International School of Riyadh Eagle. I dabbled in everything: football (still mediocre), volleyball, tennis‚Äîyou name it. But what I gained most wasn‚Äôt athletic skill; it was perspective. I met people from nearly every corner of the world. That kind of diversity shaped the way I communicate and taught me how to connect with anyone, anywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
              One summer while vacationing in Tripoli, Lebanon‚Äîsomething we did often‚Äîmy mom casually asked, ‚ÄúDo you like it here?‚Äù I said yes. Then she asked, ‚ÄúWould you move here?‚Äù I shrugged and said, ‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù And just like that, we did.
            </p>

            <p>
              I spent the next five years in Beirut. Lebanon taught me everything I know about resilience. Living through government riots, economic collapse, and the largest non-nuclear explosion in modern history will do that. But despite the instability, I was surrounded by incredible friends and a culture that instilled in me a healthy sense of competition. That environment sparked my drive to excel‚Äîespecially in math and physics‚Äîand eventually led me to the next chapter of my life in West Lafayette, Indiana.

      At Purdue University, I built a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. I specialized in Astrodynamics & Space Applications as well as Propulsion‚Äîmore of a rocket guy than a plane guy, but above all else, I was a satellite guy. Over time, I realized that while I enjoyed the technical challenges, I wasn‚Äôt as deeply passionate about traditional engineering work as some of my peers. That realization inspired me to complement my education with a minor in Business Economics.
      </p>

      <p>
      During my time at Purdue, I served as Vice President of Personnel for the Purdue Student Engineering Foundation, was consistently recognized on the Dean‚Äôs Honor List, and was selected to present a final investment recommendation to VU Venture Funds as part of an experiential learning course. Wrapping up my Bachelor's was a major milestone‚Äîbut I left with a growing curiosity about data science and artificial intelligence, which ultimately led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree.

      The desire to strengthen my coding skills, explore artificial intelligence, and bridge the gap between technology and business led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Austin. I can confidently say that choosing UT Austin was one of the best decisions of my life. It aligned my career aspirations with my genuine interests and exposed me to the cutting edge of data science and AI.
      </p>

      <p>
      Through coursework in Optimization, Advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI, I gained hands-on experience applying techniques like reinforcement learning, large language models, and diffusion models. Outside the classroom, I briefly led the MS Consulting Community, helping students prepare for consulting case interviews. I also developed several novel projects that extended lessons from class‚Äîincluding a reinforcement learning agent that won first place in a program-wide Connect Four competition.

          description="Built a first-place Connect Four AI that won a program-wide tournament using a hybrid of deep reinforcement learning and search-based techniques. Inspired by AlphaGo Zero, the system combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), a Policy Gradient model, and a shallow Minimax booster to play against humans in real-time through a custom web app."

It uses policy priors from a Policy Gradient model and board value estimates from a Double DQN to guide tree expansion. During simulations, each leaf node is evaluated using a weighted blend of the Double DQN‚Äôs prediction and a shallow-depth Minimax search. This integration improves long-term planning while adding tactical sharpness to catch short-term traps.",

Unlike the deterministic behavior of the policy gradient and Double DQN models, this agent introduces controlled randomness in its move selection, enabling greater adaptability and strategic depth. While it approaches near-optimal play, its performance is modestly constrained by imperfect value estimates from the Double DQN and a shallow-depth Minimax booster, both limited by computational efficiency trade-offs."
